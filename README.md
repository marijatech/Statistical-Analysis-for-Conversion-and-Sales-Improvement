This project is focused on optimizing e-commerce performance using **A/B testing**, **confidence intervals**, and **hypothesis testing**. We analyze customer behavior to draw data-driven insights that influence business decisions.

## Project Structure

1. **A/B Testing**: We compared two versions of a website to evaluate conversion rates and determine if there is a statistically significant difference.
   - **Result**: No statistically significant difference was found between Version A and Version B.

2. **Confidence Intervals**: We calculated the 95% confidence interval for average order values to understand customer spending behavior.
   - **Result**: The average order value lies between $187.63 and $202.58.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**: We tested if new shipping options significantly increased average daily sales.
   - **Result**: The new shipping options significantly increased average sales.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and statistical testing.
- **Libraries**: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` for visualization.
